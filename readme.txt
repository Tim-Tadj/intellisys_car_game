how to run assignment 1 milestone 2:
1) put assignment1_intellisys.py and rh.txt (file with problems given) in the same directory/folder
2) run assignment1_intellisys.py (with latest python3 interpreter) in terminal and wait until program completes question 40 and exits
3) a file called output.txt should be created in the same directory/folder, if it hasn't create an empty file "output.txt" and then re-run
4) open output.txt and observe results

Note: all questions are solved by A_star but may not be solved within time constraint
to change how long each search will run redefine the max_time_to_run varible at the top of the assignment1_intellisys.py file (by default max_time_to_run = 10s)
